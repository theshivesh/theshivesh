                            <p>
                                On March 11, 2019 we launched the Headlines, an
                                app focused on enabling readers to quickly
                                glance through the day's news and happenings. I
                                was the product designer on this project
                                contributing towards the design iterations and
                                HTML/CSS of Headlines.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here's how we made it happen.</p>
                            <h2>Why we chose to build this ?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Over the past four years, Scroll.in has grown
                                from being a daily news-magazine, somewhat
                                eccentrically publishing five stories every
                                morning, into a comprehensive, one-stop news
                                source – running the latest stories as they
                                break. 80% of our readers view stories on their
                                mobiles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As the General Elections drew near, we observed
                                that there was an opportunity to create a
                                mobile-only experience for readers to quickly
                                catch up on the news and events of the hour. The
                                intent was to create another avenue for our
                                readers to browse through latest news as well as
                                attract a new audience on Scroll. After
                                internally debating this idea, we set about
                                creating design explorations around how this
                                could take shape.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Design explorations</h2>
                            <p>
                                We started out by conducting internal design
                                interviews with select readers and members of
                                the Edit Team. Our goal was to find a pattern of
                                what readers generally look for in an experience
                                that enables them to glance through headlines.
                                We found that –
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Readers wished for a no-frills, simple
                                        and fast experience to breeze through
                                        the headlines.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        They would prefer to customise their
                                        feed specific to their interests
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        They would like to be able to easily
                                        share a news or event with their friends
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We also studied some of the apps that readers
                                used to quickly assimilate the news; Inshorts
                                and Flipboard being most popular.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Initial Iterations</h2>
                            <p>
                                Our first batch of low-fidelity mocks allowed us
                                to understand how a distraction-free, minimal UI
                                could work. The general idea was that readers
                                could swipe up or side-ways to flick through
                                headlines and tap them to read in detail. They
                                could also save, share or like a particular
                                news. Tapping the Like button could personalise
                                their feed to suit their interests. A screen at
                                the start of the app that allowed readers to
                                select categories and interest they wanted to
                                see was also considered.

                                We sat with the tech team and reviewed the
                                possibilities for V1. We decided to streamline
                                the experience and cut back on features we
                                didn't necessarily need to build the first
                                version. We also wanted to explore the
                                possibility of a full-screen, simple and
                                minimal-to-zero UI version for this app. Our
                                goal here was to enable readers to stay focused
                                on skimming through headlines. The app being
                                easy to pick up and navigate was crucial.

                                Moreover we needed to look into ways in which we
                                could showcase images in the app. At Scroll, we
                                do not have portrait version of images for the
                                news we publish. Our stories usually have two
                                major types of image crops; wide (for use in
                                article pages, social media, cards, cover story,
                                etc.) and square (for thumbnails, audio stories,
                                etc.) Do we introduce a new crop for the
                                reporters and the Edit Team to create for all
                                new stories or do we explore design solutions to
                                re-use current versions of image crops?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Lastly, Scroll has predominantly used Droid
                                family of fonts on all major products for over 4
                                years. With Headlines, we wanted to explore
                                using a system's default font to not only
                                simplify the design but also improve performance
                                of the app by avoiding external fonts.

                                The next few iterations brought us closer to the
                                original vision for the first version this app.

                                them. We also started building initial

                                PWA notification prompt.

                                These iterations had a few problems. The wide
                                aspect ratio of images caused them to get
                                insanely cropped off-screen. Lack of a
                                sub-headline meant readers had to open the
                                article to get more context on the news. While
                                re-using the card design language already
                                present on Scroll could help readers understand
                                the navigation and flow of the app, we believed
                                we could streamline this further to bring focus
                                to the feel of individual event and news.

                                In these latest iterations, we reduced the
                                height of wide aspect ratio images leading to
                                only minimal part of the image getting cropped
                                off. We also introduced a gradient to subtly
                                blend into these images. We chose the gradient
                                color by processing the visible part of the
                                image and picking a dominant color from it. If
                                the gradient color was lighter than our
                                pre-defined threshold, we turned the text and UI
                                dark.

                                The reader interaction remained similar to the
                                previous iterations; swipe left and right to
                                skim through the news, swipe down to reload the
                                app and swipe up or tap to read the news in

                                For branding inside the app, we chose to keep
                                Scroll's app logo in the top left. The Headlines
                                part would show upon launching the app and then
                                disappear after a few seconds. This enabled the
                                images to feel more immersive.

                                While the initial feedback was positive, our
                                testers were rarely swiping down to fetch new
                                stories. We dabbled with the idea of having a
                                walkthrough for major actions when the app is
                                first launched, however this posed a few
                                problems –

                                        We wanted readers to directly jump into
                                        swiping the news. A walkthrough
                                        interfered with this.

                                        Swiping left, right and up required no
                                        walkthrough as our initial test results
                                        indicated.

                                visit on the URL from desktop. Ultimately, we
                                challenged ourselves to let desktop readers get
                                a taste of using the actual product instead of
                                relying on screenshots or videos. To do this, we

                                We realised that even though Headlines was a new
                                product, tying it's identity closer to Scroll
                                could help avoid confusion for readers and let
                                us leverage the trust that they have in Scroll's
                                brand.

                            <p>
                                As we inched closer to the release date, we took
                                up the design of various promotional material
                                for Headlines. These included ads to be
                                displayed on Scroll.in (Masthead, In-article,
                                Below navigation, On Homepage, etc.) and ads for
                                social media (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter).
                                Our intent was to bring out the clean, colorful
                                and full-screen experience of Headlines in these
                                ads.

                                We launched the app on March 11, 2019. Headlines
                                received an overwhelming positive feedback from
                                readers. Over the next few months, we're looking
                                into introducing filters for category/topic,
